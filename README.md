# Madelineton

This is a barebone version of [MadelineProto](docs.madelineproto.xyz).


It has no update handling, no peer handling, no flood waits, no secret chat handling, no call handling.

It is **very** fast, faster than telethon.


The only wrapper methods that I left are a very basic and fast version of get_updates, and file upload/download methods.



Have fun.
